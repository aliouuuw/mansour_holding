## [Feature] Luxury Landing Page Redesign

* **Status:** Completed
* **Date:** 2026-02-16
* **Changes:**
  * Migrated from blue SaaS palette to `noir-950` + `gold-400` luxury identity.
  * Implemented editorial layout with `Playfair Display` serif typography.
  * Added `Lenis` for smooth scrolling and `Framer Motion` for cinematic reveals.
  * Created `CustomCursor` and `MagneticButton` interactions.
  * Replaced static grid with asymmetrical bento layout for business portfolio.
  * Refined Hero copy to "L'Autorité De l'Excellence Durable" with brand-aligned typography.
  * Improved contrast on Stats slider (`text-white/50`) and filled gaps in Portfolio grid.
  * Updated About section with distinct radial gradient background (`bg-noir-900`).
  * Aligned navigation labels to holding-level terminology: Portfolio, Accès, Espace Pro.
  * Applied brand voice guidelines: authoritative, precise, uppercase tracked nav (0.2em).
  * Fixed descender cropping in hero headline with proper line-height.
* **Brand Alignment:**
  * Hero follows "Prestige + Authority" pillars from brand definition.
  * Typography uses Sans Extrabold for main headline, Serif Italic for accents.
  * Supporting copy emphasizes unified portfolio and sovereign vision.
  * Navigation uses overline style (11px, SemiBold, 0.08em tracking) per brand spec.
